## Hierarchy

Typography in our Design System isn't just about choosing fonts; it's about setting the tone for all our communications. It encompasses the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing to the user. Our typography guidelines are crafted to ensure clarity, coherence, and beauty across all user touchpoints.

We carefully curate font families that complement our brand personality and enhance readability across various devices and resolutions. Our documentation spells out hierarchy, spacing, alignment, and responsive behavior to establish a consistent rhythm and structure in our digital offerings.

## Typography standards

Moreover, our typography standards address accessibility concerns, ensuring that text size, color contrast, and spacing meet the needs of all users, including those with visual impairments. By adhering to these guidelines, we not only uphold brand integrity but also promote an inclusive environment.

Designers and developers will find detailed specifications for typefaces, including weights, styles, and appropriate use cases. Our system provides practical examples and code snippets for integrating typography into digital products with ease and consistency.

Through our thoughtful approach to typography, we aim to create a seamless and engaging narrative for our audience, empowering them to interact with our content intuitively and effortlessly.
