## UI application

Handling date and time is a common but crucial part of user interfaces, reflecting both local customs and international standards. Our Design System provides a suite of patterns to present and manipulate temporal information effectively and intuitively.

We start by considering the global nature of our audience, offering patterns that adapt to different locales for date and time formatting. Consistency in these patterns ensures users feel at home regardless of where they are or what language they speak.

Our patterns for date and time include easily readable formats for short and long-form dates, relative time expressions, and user-friendly time selection tools. We've also baked in accessibility considerations, ensuring that screen readers can interpret and relay temporal data without confusion.

## Patterns

Developers and designers can rely on our patterns to manage complex scheduling within applications, handling everything from simple timestamps to intricate calendars. We provide clear guidelines on integrating these patterns within various platforms, ensuring they are robust enough to handle time zone variations and daylight saving changes.

By standardizing the way we present dates and times, we aim to eliminate user confusion and streamline interactions across all digital products. The consistency of these patterns helps in creating a seamless temporal experience that users can trust, enhancing the overall usability of our digital environments.
